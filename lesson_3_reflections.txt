When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
- When working with a team
- when working on a remote computer

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
- You need to be able to choose when to update your local version after checking the updates
