What happens when you initialise a repository? Why do you need to do it?
- Git creates a hidden directory, ".git" which stores metadata trackiing commits

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
- working area contains work in progress - up to the minute files
- repository contains commits
- staging area allows you to add logical changes or combinations of files to bundle into a single logical unit to commit to repository.

How can you use the staging area to make suure you have one commit per logical change?
- use git add <filename> to add changed file to the staging area
- use git diff --staged to make sure of what is in the file in the staging area

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organised? How would branches help?
- When working on new/experimental version when you want to keep to old version intact
- Allows you to work independently on both branches
