How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
- working area contains work in progress - up to the minute files
- repository contains commits

How can you use the staging area to make suure you have one commit per logical change?
- use git add <filename> to add changed file to the staging area
- use git diff --staged to make sure of what is in the file in the staging area
