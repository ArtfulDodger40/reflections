What happens when you initialise a repository? Why do you need to do it?
- Git creates a hidden directory, ".git" which stores metadata trackiing commits

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
- working area contains work in progress - up to the minute files
- repository contains commits
- staging area allows you to add logical changes or combinations of files to bundle into a single logical unit to commit to repository.
